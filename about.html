            <p>I'm Kapilesh. Originally from New Delhi, India. I did my graduation from Delhi Technological University under the B.Tech. programme in Mechanical and Automotive Engineering. Rather disillusioned by traditional MechE courses, I decided to undertake a number of extra-curricular projects encompassing competitive coding, artificial intelligence, biodiesel extraction, hydraulic suspensions, hoping to find what I like. I was eventually drawn to software engineering due to its versatility and its ability to solve problems and make life easy.</p>

            <p>In the past few decades softwares essentially solved countless real world problems and have grown exponentially to pervade almost everything around us. Mobile technology has taken a huge leap and has become an inseparable part of life for most of us.</p>

            <p>I hope to be on the right side of this revolution and contribute as much as I can to our technological evolution :).</p>

            <p>In my free time I like to explore new music, figure out some new tunes on my guitar, go trekking, stargazing, cruise around on my skateboard and plenty of other things depending on who's around and what's happening. Recently I also got into learning Chromatic Harmonica.</p>
