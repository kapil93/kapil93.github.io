            <p>Hi, I'm Kapilesh. I work in the Android team at intive. Originally from New Delhi, I did my graduation from Delhi Technological University under the B.Tech. programme in Mechanical and Automotive Engineering. Rather disillusioned by traditional MechE courses, I decided to undertake a number of extra-curricular projects encompassing competitive coding, artificial intelligence, biodiesel extraction, hydraulic suspensions, general relativity, cosmology, quantum physics, philosophy, hoping to find what I like. I was eventually drawn to software engineering due to its versatility and its ability to solve problems in an automated fashion reliably and make life easy.</p>

            <p>In the past few decades, softwares essentially has solved countless real world problems and has grown exponentially to pervade almost every industry. Mobile technology has taken a huge leap and has become an inseparable part of life for most of us.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, extensive research and technological advancements in the field of Machine Learning has further advanced our Limited Memory AI capabilities</p>

            <p>I hope to be on the right side of this revolution and contribute as much as I can to our technological evolution. It rhymed! :D.</p>

            <p>In my free time I like to explore new music, figure out some new tunes on my guitar, go hiking, stargazing and plenty of other things depending on who's around and what's happening. Recently, I also got into learning Chromatic Harmonica.</p>

            <p>Feel free to drop in a message to discuss AI, physics, philosophy or just to say Hi! :)</p>
