## Timeline

### Overview
A companion cross-platform mobile app for [Timex | Blink fitness band](http://store.blink.watch/collections/timex-blink/) which processes and presents the data collected from the band and controls its functionalities via BLE.

### Challenges We faced
This project was built using React-Native. One of my colleagues, with Web Frontend experience, and I were tasked to build this app from scratch and neither of us had any prior knowledge about React-Native.

Efficient Database Syncing between the phone and the band was implemented which transferred only unsynced data effectively through BLE.
