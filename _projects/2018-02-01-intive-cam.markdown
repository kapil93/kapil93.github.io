### Overview
This was an internal project to publish information about company news and events.

<br>

This was my first professional project which was written in Kotlin. Moreover, most aspects of the app were new to me in a professional setup such as the libraries used, namely RxJava and Dagger, and the architecture, which was Clean Architecture with MVI.

The introduction to these new technologies and practices in this project got me immensely excited to learn and use them.
