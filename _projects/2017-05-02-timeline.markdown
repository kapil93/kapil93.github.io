## Timeline

### Overview
A calendar app for [Blink Smartwatch](https://blink.watch) which primarily fetches events from google calendar. Events and reminders can also be created from the watch itself.

It supports all kinds of recurring events that can be created through Google calendar and notifies the same using Alarm Manager API.

### Challenges We faced
The primary blocker in the course of making this project was the absence of Google Play Services in the watch. So it was ruled out that we could fetch the events directly and display them.

We had to parse the string containing recurrence rules ourselves and display the events using correct logic.

The complex UI of this app enabled us to learn quite a lot about the canvas API. Arcs were drawn corresponding to the timings of the events. Also due to the numbers positioned in the screen, the arcs were split recursively to arrive at the precise logic for the representation of the timeline events.

Efficient Database Syncing between the phone and the watch was implemented which transferred only unsynced data to the other device effectively through BLE.
