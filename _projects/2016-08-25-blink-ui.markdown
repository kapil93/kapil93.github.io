## Blink UI
------------

### Overview
A UI/UX library containing plug and play UI components for Marvin OS, which is mainly based on Android Lollipop and powers the [Blink Smartwatch](https://blink.watch).

Blink UI is a submodule for almost all apps in the watch and all the components it contains are standardized across the platform.

Blink is a smartwatch based on Android having a circular screen, which kinda makes it necessary for almost every UI element to be a custom component.
