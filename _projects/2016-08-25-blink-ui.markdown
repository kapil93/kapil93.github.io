## Blink UI
------------

### Overview
A UI/UX library containing plug and play UI components for Marvin OS, which is mainly based on Android Lollipop and powers the [Blink Smartwatch](https://blink.watch).

Blink UI is a submodule for almost all apps in the watch and all the components it contains are standardized across the platform.

Circular screen of the watch kinda makes it necessary for almost every UI element to be a custom component.
