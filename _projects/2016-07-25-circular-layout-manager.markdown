## Circular Layout Manager
---------------------------

### Overview
A library for Android which essentially contains a Custom Layout Manager for Recycler View which lays out its child views in circular or elliptical fashion.

An implementation of a scroll wheel is built which enables the user to scroll the list with a circular motion of the finger.

Circular Relative Layout is provided to clip the layout containing recycler view into an ellipse or a circle.
